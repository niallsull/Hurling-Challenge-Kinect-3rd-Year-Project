Hurling-Challenge-Kinect-3rd-Year-Project
=========================================

Hurling fee taking game I made for my 3rd year project using the Kinect with xna

Much of my code is the physics and reading the kinect

A model striking the ball is used which was created by David McDermott (Giant Oak Studios)

The implementation of the models animation is handled by a remake of microsofts skinning sample
